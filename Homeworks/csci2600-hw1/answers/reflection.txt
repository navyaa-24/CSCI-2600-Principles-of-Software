1.     In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this homework?
	Most of the time I spent doing the homework was largely spent attempting the logic in my head (I was lazy), so I could likely have
	cut down on a decent amount of time by working out the problems on paper and giving rough work to allow myself to keep a better
	track of my work.


2.     What could I (the instructor) have done better to improve your learning experience in this homework?
	I think that the homework was good in the sense that the topics that appeared were covered well and didn't involve super specific
	test cases. I think I would have liked better methods to provide answers (possibly more examples or templates?) as it did seem a 
	little crowded and dense in question 4 but concept learning wise I saw no issues.


3.     What do you know now that you did not know before beginning the homework?
	I have a much better grasp on condition strengths (I think) than before the homework as I was a bit iffy but only realized while
	doing the homework itself. I did do more outside the homework after identifying it though.
