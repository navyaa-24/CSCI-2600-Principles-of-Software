1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException
 test? What did you have to do to fix it?
 
 	The Fibonacci test failed because the first statement checked for
 	 all numbers less than or equal to 0 in order to throw an exception
 	 This is incorrect as 0 is a valid input which is not covered by the program.
 	 It was fixed by removing the = from the <= in the first if statement.
 
 
 
2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything)
 did you have to do to fix it?
 
 	In terms of why this test failed and its solution, it is largely similar
 	 to question 1 except that the testBaseCase is checking for the values of
 	 the base case to be equal rather than checking for the presence of an 
 	 exception. The solution is the same as question 1.
 
 
 
3. Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything)
 did you have to do to fix it?
 
 	This test failed for a similar assertion to question 2 in that it checked for
 	 the correctness of Fibonacci values. However, the problem during this test came 
 	 from a combination of failure during 0 as well as two additional problems.
 	 The first was that 2 was considered to be part of the base case which it should
 	 not and the second is the recursive formula used:
 	 			getFibTerm(n + 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2)
 	 which does not match the formula required. The test was fixed by removing the
 	 = from <= in both the first and second if statements and changing the return to:
 	 			getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2)
