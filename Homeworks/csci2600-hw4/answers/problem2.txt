For my tests, I attempted to use the Equivalence Partitioning heuristic. This heuristic focuses on covering all possible combinations or 
possibilities for input (though it can be for outputs, etc. I focused on more on inputs). Through this, I attempted to list all the possible input
conditions that can be input and the intended outcomes from these.

I went back and added three specific test cases I had forgotten about that will test when the addEdge is being added with Nodes outside the Graph.
