Added method numNodes for testing purposes.
Added method numEdges for testing purposes.
Added method clear for clearing in the start of createNewGraph.
Added method contains for checking for node presence in the graph for path.
Added method listChildrenSorted for finding the children of a node and sorting them automatically.

Changed from two TreeSets that stored nodes and edges to a map with String keys to HashSet Edges values that makes finding children much more 
practical in Graph
