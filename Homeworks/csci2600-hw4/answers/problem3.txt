My code represented a Collection of Nodes and a collection of Edges that exist independent of one another. 
	The advantages of such a method are that it makes it easy to access the Nodes or Edges independant of each other and visualization of 
	the graph becomes much easier.


As a collection of edges.
	It allows for simple Object structure and will take up less memory as the Graph gets larger.


As an adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
	It is easy to keep track of the Nodes in the graph and the children of each node and makes adding Nodes or Edges simple.


As an adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of edges, whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.
	It will show all possible Edges which makes accessing, checking, adding or removing specific Edges bery easy.
