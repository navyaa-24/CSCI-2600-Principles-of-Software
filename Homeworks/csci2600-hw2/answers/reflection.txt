1.      In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this homework?
	I believe that I spent a relatively short amount of time and any less time likely would have compromised the quality of my work.
	
	
2.      What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the homework?
	Through this homework, I believe I got a better grasp on formatting loop invariants, though my methods of proof did not see much 
	change. In terms of knowledge wanted before hand other than in how to format loop invariant specifically, I think we covered everything
	well.
